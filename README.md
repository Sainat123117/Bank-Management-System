# Bank-Management-System
A robust, console-based Bank Management System written in C. Features include account creation, money transfer, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history, utilizing file handling for data persistence and a Makefile for build automation.

A low-level implementation of a banking system developed in C on a Linux environment. This project focuses on **systems programming concepts** including file stream manipulation, modular compilation with Makefiles, and efficient memory usage.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
* **Core Logic:** Implemented in pure C using standard libraries.
* **Build System:** Custom `Makefile` for incremental compilation and object file management.
* **Data Storage:** Persistent storage using flat-file database techniques (`.txt` files).

## 🔧 Technical Highlights
* **Modular Codebase:** Separated interface (`.h`) and implementation (`.c`) to simulate professional driver development.
* **File I/O:** Robust reading/writing of transaction logs and user data.
* **Pointer Arithmetic:** Used for efficient data handling within functions.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Build:** `make`
2. **Run:** `./bank`
3. **Clean:** `make clean` (Removes `.o` object files)
